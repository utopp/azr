Description: Implements a credential chain for 'Azure OAuth 2.0' authentication 
      based on the package 'httr2''s 'OAuth' framework. Sequentially attempts authentication 
      methods until one succeeds. During development allows interactive 
      browser-based flows ('Device Code' and 'Auth Code' flows) and non-interactive 
      flow ('Client Secret') in batch mode.
